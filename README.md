# Researcher

A simple monospaced resume theme for Hugo. It was ported from Jekyll theme
[ankitsultana/researcher](https://github.com/ankitsultana/researcher).

## Installation

This theme uses Sass to generate CSS files so make sure you have the
*extended* Hugo version installed.

Add the theme to your site's `themes` directory:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/emaballarin/hugo-researcher.git themes/researcher
# if your website is not managed by git:
# git clone https://github.com/emaballarin/hugo-researcher.git themes/researcher
```

Update the theme option in `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "researcher"
```
